# Parsa's Genome Library

This repository contains digital copies of my (Parsa Ghaffari's) genetic material, obtained via raw data exports from genotyping and sequencing services such as [23andMe](https://23andme.com/). 

By making this data public, I hope to: 

- Make a small contribution to research on genetics and genomics
- Encourage others to contribute their genetic data to research, as I strongly believe in the power of crowdsourced research and development
- Leave a long lasting digital copy of my source code!
